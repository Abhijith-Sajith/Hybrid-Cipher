# Hybrid-Cipher

This repository consist of different python codes that satisfies a hybrid cipher involving substitution and position cipher. The keys in the code are randomly generated hence making it more secure. This is based on a research paper "A Novel Hybrid Encryption Technique for Cloud Data Security" by Papri Das and Sunil Kumarin the 2023 3rd International Conference on Advance Computing and Innovative Technologies in Engineering (ICACITE).
